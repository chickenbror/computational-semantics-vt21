    "## 5. Semantic composition and phrase similarity **[20 marks]**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, we are going to look at how different semantic composition models, introduced in [2] correlate with human judgements. The file with the dataset is `mitchell_lapata_acl08.txt` included with this notebook. Your task is to do the following:  \n",
    "\n",
    "(i) process the dataset, extract pairs of `reference - landmark high` and `reference - landmark low`; you can use the code from the lecture as something to start with. Note that there are 2 landmarks for each reference: one landmark exhibits high similarity with the reference, while another one has low similarity with the reference. A single human participant could have evaluated both of these pairs. For more details, we refer you to the paper.  \n",
    "\n",
    "(ii) build models of semantic phrase composition: in the lecture we introduced simple additive, simple multiplicative and combined models (details are in [2]). Your task is to take a single pair (a reference or a high similarity landmark or a low similarity landmark) and compute the composition of its vectors using each of these functions. Thus, you will have three compositional models that take a `noun - verb` pair and output a single vector, representing the meaning of this pair. As your semantic space, you can use pretrained spaces (standard space, ppmi or svd) introduced above. It is up to you which space you use, but for someone who runs your code, it should be pretty straightforward to switch between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "(iii) calculate Spearman correlation between each model's predictions and human judgements; you should have something similar to the scores that are shown in the paper [2]:  "
