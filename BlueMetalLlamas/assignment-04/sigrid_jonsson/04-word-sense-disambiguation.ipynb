    "A problem with static distributional vectors is the difficulty of distinguishing between different *word senses*. We will continue our exploration of word vectors by considering *trainable vectors* or *word embeddings* for Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD).\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of word sense disambiguation is to train a model to find the sense of a word (homonyms of a word-form). For example, the word \"bank\" can mean \"sloping land\" or \"financial institution\". \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "(b) \"I swam from the river **bank**\" (sloping land)\n",
    "\n",
    "In case a) and b) we can determine that the meaning of \"bank\" based on the *context*. To utilize context in a semantic model we use *contextualized word representations*. Previously we worked with *static word representations*, i.e. the representation does not depend on the context. To illustrate we can consider sentences (a) and (b), the word **bank** would have the same static representation in both sentences, which means that it becomes difficult for us to predict its sense. What we want is to create representations that depend on the context, i.e. *contextualized embeddings*. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will create contextualized embeddings with Recurrent Neural Networks. You can read more about recurrent neural netoworks [here](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/). Your overall task in this lab is to create a neural network model that can disambiguate the word sense of 15 different words. "

    "### Creating data iterators\n",
    "\n",
    "To train a neural network, we first need to prepare the data. This involves converting words (and labels) to a number, and organizing the data into batches. We also want the ability to shuffle the examples such that they appear in a random order.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To do all of this we will use the torchtext library (https://torchtext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). In addition to converting our data into numerical form and creating batches, it will generate a word and label vocabulary, and data iterators than can sort and shuffle the examples. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to create a dataloader for the training and test set you created previously. So, how do we go about doing this?\n",
    "\n",
    "1) First we create a ``Field`` for each of our columns. A field is a function which tokenize the input, keep a dictionary of word-to-numbers, and fix paddings. So, we need four fields, one for the word-sense, one for the position, one for the lemma and one for the context. \n",
    "\n",
    "2) After we have our fields, we need to process the data. For this we use the ``TabularDataset`` class. We pass the name and path of the training and test files we created previously, then we assign which field to use in each column. The result is that each column will be processed by the field indicated. So, the context column will be tokenized and processed by the context field and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "3) After we have processed the dataset we need to build the vocabulary, for this we call the function ``build_vocab()`` on the different ``Fields`` with the output from ``TabularDataset`` as input. This looks at our dataset and creates the necessary vocabularies (word-to-number mappings). \n",
    "\n",
    "4) Finally, the last step. In the last step we load the data objects given by the ``TabularDataset`` and pass it to the ``BucketIterator`` class. This class will organize our examples into batches and shuffle them around (such that for each epoch the model observe the examples in a different order). When we are done with this we can let our function return the data iterators and vocabularies, then we are ready to train and test our model!\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the dataloader. [**2 marks**]\n",
    "\n",
